                <h2>"joo-no"</h2>
                <p>Juneau, being the capital of Alaska, is a scenic coastal city nestled between the towering peaks of the Coast Mountains and the waters of the Gastineau Channel. As Alaska’s capital, Juneau is unique in that it’s accessible only by air or sea, giving it a remote and charmingly secluded feel. The city is renowned for its lush rainforest landscape, historic downtown, and striking glaciers like the Mendenhall Glacier, just a short drive away. Juneau combines the rugged beauty of Alaska with a vibrant arts and culture scene, celebrating both its Gold Rush history and the rich heritage of the Tlingit people. With opportunities for whale watching, hiking, and exploring glacial landscapes, Juneau is a gateway to the natural wonders of Southeast Alaska.</p>
